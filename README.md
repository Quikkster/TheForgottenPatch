# Robert Bowlings' Forgotten Patch Update: Remastered
 A recreation of the forgotten final patch update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009) that was originally created by Infinity Ward's Community Manager at the time, Robert Bowling. This patch planned to fix many glitches, bugs, exploits & errors, such as One Man Army Noob Tubes, Red Dot Sights being misaligned, MOST of the weapon attachment options causing a huge percentage of weapons to break/unintentionally change in terms of damage, accuracy, range, etc. & much more! This is my rendition of it, enjoy!
 
## Changes Made So Far:
_**Weapons**_
* `FAL`: Fix `Holographic Sight`, raises minimum damage from 35 to 40. Coupled with Stopping Power, 2 body shots can kill at any distance, even with a silencer.
* `Spas-12`: Fix `FMJ`, had no effect on bullet penetration.
* `M9`, `M240`, `MG4`: Fix `silencer`, when shooting you show up on radar still.<br />

_**One Man Army**_
* Disable changing to the same class to exploit ammo refilling
* If changing to a class with a grenade launcher, grenade launcher will now be empty

### `Where do I install / clone the repo to?`<br />
When chosing the install location for the cloned repo, clone it **directly** into your MW2/iW4x game directory, this will install everything you need including the iW4x.exe (to bypass the xLabs launcher being shutdown), the custom iw4x dll used for trickshotting features such as instantshoot & smooth actions, as well as the full mod and gamemode config files used for easy setup!<br />
## iW4x - Method 2:
_**(not recommended if you want to stay up to date with this mod - we update DAILY!)**_

* Extract the contents of the zip folder into your iW4x directory <br />

# `The Forgotten Patch: Starting Up The Mod`
## iW4x:
* After follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Quikkster/TheForgottenPatch/tree/main#the-forgotten-patch-mod-installation-guide) You can open the mods folder and then the `FableAzza` folder. <br />
* Within the `TheForgottenPatch` folder, run the bat file that matches the startup method you would like to use: <br />

### `!start mod.bat` 
* opens up iW4x 
* skips the iW4x intro cutscene 
* auto launches the mod
* execs the server config file which sets up all the settings.<br />

### `!instant start azza.bat` 
* opens up a terminal cmd box that allows you to enter specific settings before it boots up the game
`MAPNAME: a mapname of your choice or press ENTER to enter in Highrise as a default`
* opens up iW4x
* skip the iW4x intro cutscene
* auto launches the mod
* execs the server config file which sets up all the settings.
* **BUT WILL THEN** skip the entire menu / private match setup process and put you straight into a match on the map you chose. (good for if you already have classes set up and want to skip all the extra menu navigation)<br />
